# Web3Recommenz

## Project Overview

This project is a collaborative effort by Leo, Corey, and Nelson. The team has selected Challenge 4, focusing on the implementation of Federated Learning System and Incremental Learning sub-challenges. The goal is to explore and develop solutions in the field of machine learning that address the challenges posed by distributed and continuously evolving data.

## Sub-Challenges

### 1. Decentralized Federated Learning System

In the Federated Learning System sub-challenge, our team aims to build a robust and scalable federated learning system. This involves developing algorithms and protocols that enable machine learning models to be trained across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy and security.

### 2. Decentralized Incremental Learning

The Incremental Learning sub-challenge focuses on the development of models that can adapt and learn continuously as new data becomes available. Our team will explore techniques for updating the model with new information without discarding previously acquired knowledge, making it well-suited for scenarios with evolving datasets.

## Getting Started
